## 1. What counts as physical activity?

###  Definition of physical activity
"Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure" (Caspersen et al., 1985)

![Runners in a park]({{ '/pics/jogging-4211946.jpg' | relative_url }})

Physical activity is any body movement that uses energy. It includes movement during free time, travel/transport, and daily tasks at work or home (World Health Organization, 2020). For example, walking to class, taking the stairs, cleaning, playing sports, or exercising, all of these count as physical activity.

###  Physical activity principle (FITT)
Physical activity is commonly described using the FITT principle: frequency (how often), intensity (how hard), time (how long), and type (what kind of activity)

</div>

'I run for 60 minutes once a week, and I feel breathing hard, but I can still talk to others while doing it.'
Frequency: once a week; Intensity: moderate; Time: 60 minutes; Type: running

###  Physical activity guideline
Move more, sit less, every bit counts! Even small amounts of moderate-to-vigorous activity provide health benefits, and meeting activity guidelines brings even more.

## 2. Why physical activity matters?
In adults, physical activity provides health benefits in the following areas (World Health Organization, 2020; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018):

- Improved all-cause mortality
- Cardiovascular disease mortality
- Incident hypertension
- Incident site-specific cancers
- Incident type-2 diabetes
- Mental health (reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression)
- Cognitive health (academic performance, mental processing speed, memory, and executive function)
- Sleep
- Overweight or obesity

</figure>

Adults should focus on the benefits that matter most to them. For some, health improvements are enough motivation to be active. For others, different personal reasons are more motivating. For example, physical activity can (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018): 

- Offers opportunities for enjoyable, often social, recreational activities;
- Improves personal appearance, energy levels, and overall well-being; and
- Creates chances to support and be active with family members or friends

###  Risks of Sedentary Behavior

Sedentary behavior means any waking activity that uses very little energy (≤1.5 METs) while sitting, reclining, or lying down. It includes time spent sitting at work or during leisure, such as watching TV (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018).

Note: METs, metabolic equivalents. METs are used to quantify energy expenditure as multiples of the resting metabolic rate. 1 MET is the rate of energy expenditure while sitting at rest.

## 3. Getting started
Start with a simple, low-barrier, high-benefit exercise: walking/jogging. Learn warm-ups, technique, pacing, and breathing from the source below:

## 4. Fuel your body, rest your mind
For a healthier lifestyle, more energy, and better physical activity performance, sleep and nutrition matter. Adults aged 18-64 are recommended to get 7-9 hours of good-quality sleep regularly, along with a healthy diet. Use the tips below to support better sleep and healthier eating.

### Tip for falling asleep faster and sleeping better (National Health Service, n.d.)

1) Have a good sleep routine (sleep hygiene)
A consistent sleep routine (good sleep hygiene) improves sleep. Set a nightly wind-down time with a relaxing activity, and go to bed and wake up at the same times every day—even on weekends.

2) Relax, unwind and try meditation to help you sleep
Your sleep routine starts before bed. Relax each evening, avoid screens for at least an hour, and try reading, soft music/podcasts, or sleep meditation to help you fall asleep.

[When you're ready to sleep, listen to this audio-only video to help you to relax](https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/#video).

3) Try mindfulness for sleep
Stress and worry can disrupt sleep, so try daily mindfulness habits like talking to someone you trust or journaling. If you lie awake overthinking, make a to-do list before bed to clear your mind.

4) Create the right sleep environment
Create a sleep-friendly space. Keep it quiet, dark, and cool. Use earplugs or silence your phone, block light with curtains and hide clocks/screens, keep the room well-ventilated, and try ambient sounds or white noise if it helps.

5) Do not force sleep
Don't force sleep. If rest is pleasant, let sleep come naturally. If you can't sleep, get up and do something calming (like reading or quiet music), then return to bed when you feel sleepy.

6) Improve sleep through diet and exercise
Better sleep is supported by a healthy diet and regular exercise. Avoid big meals near bedtime, and cut out caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine 1-2 hours before bed. Exercise regularly, but skip intense workouts in the 90 minutes before sleep if they keep you awake.

### Tip for Healthy Eating (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2024)

1) Bump up fiber
Fiber supports digestion, keeps you fuller longer, helps manage blood sugar, and can lower cholesterol. Good sources include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

For example: Slice raw vegetables for quick snacks. Start your day with a whole-grain cereal, like oatmeal.

2) Increase calcium and vitamin D
Calcium and vitamin D support strong bones. Vitamin D can come from sunlight, but some people don't make enough, so fortified foods and drinks can help.

For example: Cook with spinach, collard greens, bok choy, mushrooms, and taro root. Drink a fortified dairy beverage with your meals.

3) Add more potassium
Potassium supports the kidneys, heart, muscles, and nerves. Too little can raise blood pressure, weaken bones, and increase kidney stone risk. Most people in the U.S. need more, but those with kidney disease or on certain meds may need to limit it.

For example: Try new recipes that use beets, lima beans, or Swiss chard. Have a banana as a snack.

4) Limit added sugars
They can increase risk of weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Added sugars include syrups like corn syrup, dextrose, and fructose, as well as table sugar, honey, and maple syrup, with sugary drinks being the common source.

For example: Drink water instead of sugary drinks. At coffee shops, skip the flavored syrups and whipped cream.

5) Replace saturated fats
Swap saturated fats for healthier unsaturated fats to support heart health. Saturated fats are common in fatty meats, full-fat dairy, butter, and cream cheese, while unsaturated fats are generally the better choice.

For example: Replace whole milk in a smoothie with low-fat yogurt and an avocado. Cook with oil instead of butter or margarine.

6) Cut back on sodium
Reduce sodium to lower the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. Most sodium comes from packaged and prepared foods, and about 90% of what we consume is from salt.

For example: Eat high-sodium processed and prepackaged food (breads, pizza, and deli meats) less frequently.

7) Aim for a variety of colors
Eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables, foods like oranges, tomatoes, leafy greens, and herbs provide lots of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

For example: Make a red sauce with fresh tomatoes, fresh herbs, and spices. Top low-fat, unsweetened yogurt with your favorite fruit.
